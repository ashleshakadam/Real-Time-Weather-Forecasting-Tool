# Overview

To develop this application, the trifecta of web technologies, i.e., HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used. Node.js and Express Technologies helped in creating a proper back-end of the app server in JavaScript. Weather data is extracted from https://openweathermap.org/api using API calls. An input textbox is conjured in the app's UI where users can enter the name of a location.
